## Welcome to Trac!

Trac lets you record your time with ease. Predefined categories save you from tedious decision-making around organisation - but does not limit your freedom as you can have as many sub-categories and activities as you like. 

Your activities can be viewed on a daily basis with daily stats - as well as historically with aggregated stats over daily, weekly and monthly time periods. 

You can add various types of notes and memories to your current activity which can be viewed as a daily timeline across activities or historical timeline for a single activity or note. 

So all that you need to do is start Trac'ing your activity and get on with it - only to reap the benefits by analysing your patterns over time!
